  abstract      = {With the increasing commoditization of computer vision, speech recognition and machine translation systems and the widespread deployment of learning-based back-end technologies such as digital advertising and intelligent infrastructures, AI (Artificial Intelligence) has moved from research labs to production. These changes have been made possible by unprecedented levels of data and computation, by methodological advances in machine learning, by innovations in systems software and architectures, and by the broad accessibility of these technologies. The next generation of AI systems promises to accelerate these developments and increasingly impact our lives via frequent interactions and making (often mission-critical) decisions on our behalf, often in highly personalized contexts. Realizing this promise, however, raises daunting challenges. In particular, we need AI systems that make timely and safe decisions in unpredictable environments, that are robust against sophisticated adversaries, and that can process ever increasing amounts of data across organizations and individuals without compromising confidentiality. These challenges will be exacerbated by the end of the Moore's Law, which will constrain the amount of data these technologies can store and process. In this paper, we propose several open research directions in systems, architectures, and security that can address these challenges and help unlock AI's potential to improve lives and society.},

  abstract      = {SAP is the market leader in enterprise software offering an end-to-end suite of applications and services to enable their customers worldwide to operate their business. Especially, retail customers of SAP deal with millions of sales transactions for their day-to-day business. Transactions are created during retail sales at the point of sale (POS) terminals and then sent to some central servers for validations and other business operations. A considerable proportion of the retail transactions may have inconsistencies due to many technical and human errors. SAP provides an automated process for error detection but still requires a manual process by dedicated employees using workbench software for correction. However, manual corrections of these errors are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may lead to further errors due to incorrect modifications. This is not only a performance overhead on the customers' business workflow but it also incurs high operational costs. Thus, automated detection and correction of transaction errors are very important regarding their potential business values and the improvement in the business workflow. In this paper, we present an industrial case study where we apply machine learning (ML) to automatically detect transaction errors and propose corrections. We identify and discuss the challenges that we faced during this collaborative research and development project, from three distinct perspectives: Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and industry-academia collaboration. We report on our experience and insights from the project with guidelines for the identified challenges. We believe that our findings and recommendations can help researchers and practitioners embarking into similar endeavors.},

  abstract      = {Specific developmental and operational characteristics of machine learning (ML) components, as well as their inherent uncertainty, demand robust engineering principles are used to ensure their quality. We aim to determine how software systems can be (re-) architected to enable robust integration of ML components. Towards this goal, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study consisting of (i) a systematic literature review to identify the challenges and their solutions in software architecture forML, (ii) semi-structured interviews with practitioners to qualitatively complement the initial findings, and (iii) a survey to quantitatively validate the challenges and their solutions. In total, we compiled and validated twenty challenges and solutions for (re-) architecting systems with ML components. Our results indicate, for example, that traditional software architecture challenges (e.g., component coupling) also play an important role when using ML components; along new ML specific challenges (e.g., the need for continuous retraining). Moreover, the results indicate that ML heightened decision drivers, such as privacy, play a marginal role compared to traditional decision drivers, such as scalability or interoperability. Using the survey, we were able to establish a link between architectural solutions and software quality attributes; which enabled us to provide twenty architectural tactics used for satisfying individual quality requirements of systems with ML components. Altogether, the results can be interpreted as an empirical framework that supports the process of (re-) architecting software systems with ML components.},
