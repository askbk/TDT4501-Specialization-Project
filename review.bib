Primary research challenges identified:
- federated learning infrastructure: solutions are needed for federated learning and the sharing of model parameters such as neural network weights as well as selected data sets that, for instance, represent cases not well handled by the central model. Federated learning requires an infrastructure to achieve the required quality attributes and to efficiently and securely share models and data.
- storage and computing infrastructure: many companies use internal infrastructure instead of cloud services. can be because of legal constraints, costs or quality attributes.
- deployment infrastructure: it is important for a deployment infrastructure to reliably deploy subsequent versions of models, measure their performance, raise warnings and initiate rollbacks in the case of anomalous behaviour.},

  comment   = {“systematic lifecycle support-including continuous development, training, testing, and deployment of models-and continuous integration [2] for AI is still in its infancy. We think one reason for this is the lack of tools and methodologies to support the development lifecycles of AI solutions, spanning data preparation, model design and training, application development, quality checks (e.g., security, bias, compliance, etc.), deployment, monitoring, and feedback, as well as the reproducibility and auditability of the entire process.”
- pluggability: “Lifecycle services must be easily pluggable and customizable, e.g. bias or robustness checks. some AI pipelines still require human in the loop.”
- reusability: keep config effort to a minimum. users should be able to use pre-configured templates and patterns for pipelines and lifecycle capabilities.
- flexibility: The system needs to meet developers and data scientists where they are, and integrate with the tools and services they already use and are comfortable with.
- scalability: The system needs to provide scalability across different dimensions - including model metadata versioning, parallel pipeline executions, event processing, and model performance monitoring.
- hybrid environments: While there is a general move to the cloud, a significant number of AI systems use on-premise servers, dedicated clusters, edge devices, or a combination of these. Resource and security heterogeneity in such hybrid environments introduce a number of challenges.
- fault tolerance: As ModelOps pipelines plug together a wide range of tools and infrastructure, many things can fail. For example, we found that 8% of all data preprocessing tasks in WML fail or finish with errors, and therefore would stall the subsequent training of a model. This is particularly problematic for automated pipelines of critical models.},

Improvements to raw data can harm results: “Currently we must manually retrain our model with updated raw data, and deploy the new model and raw data into production at the same time. In addition to being time consuming, this solution is less-than-ideal since it requires us to know of the upstream change. Ideally, we would automate the continual retraining of our model, which would incorporate any change in upstream data.”},
