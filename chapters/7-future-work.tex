\chapter{Future Work}
\label{ch:future_work}
Several opportunities for future research were identified in \cref{ch:research_results:rq4_gaps}.
The most prominent opportunities identified are related to serving performance and edge \acrshort{ml} operationalization.
In serving, there is the open problem of optimizing query response times with respect to accuracy and resource scaling costs during load spikes.
In edge deployments, there are an array of opportunities for further research, related to scalable monitoring, scalable scheduling, and scalable provisioning of heterogeneous hardware resources.

Although initially intended to be an \acrshort{mlr}, the scope of this study had to be reduced to only encompass an \acrshort{slr} because of time constraints.
A natural next step would thus be to conduct a \acrshort{glr} to investigate practitioner knowledge on the subject using a similar methodology and research questions.

\acrshort{ml} model management, also referred to as ModelOps \cite{Hummer2019}, is a closely related field concerned with model lifecycle management, tracking model versions and model lineage.
There exists no published literature reviews on the subject, despite being an important component for ensuring proper \acrshort{ai} governance.
Further research on the topic should therefore be conducted in the future.
