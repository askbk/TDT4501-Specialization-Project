\chapter*{Abstract}
Deploying \acrfull{ml} models to production with the same level of rigor and automation as traditional software systems has shown itself to be a non-trivial task, requiring extra care and infrastructure to deal with the additional challenges.
This study is a systematic literature review investigating the state of the art in operationalizing \acrshort{ml} models using the following research questions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1: How are \acrshort{ml} models operationalized in the state of the art?}
    \item \textbf{RQ2: What are the main challenges in operationalizing \acrshort{ml} models?}
    \item \textbf{RQ3: What tools and software infrastructure are used to operationalize \acrshort{ml} models?}
    \item \textbf{RQ4: What are the feature gaps in the tooling and infrastructure used to operationalize \acrshort{ml} models?}
\end{itemize}
The results of the review show that there are many different techniques for operationalizing ML models, and there exists a number of tools for the most common use cases, cloud deployment in particular. 
The review also revealed several opportunities for research into better tooling and infrastructure, particularly for serving and edge \acrshort{ml} deployments.
The results of the study should provide a better overview of different deployment approaches and architectures than previous reviews on the topic, as well as giving an overview of some of the tooling used and opportunities for future research.
