\chapter*{Abstract}

This study investigates the state of the art in operationalizing ML models by way of a systematic literature review with the following research questions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1: How are ML models operationalized in the state of the art?}
    \item \textbf{RQ2: What are the main challenges in operationalizing ML models?}
    \item \textbf{RQ3: What tools and software infrastructure are used to operationalize ML models?}
    \item \textbf{RQ4: What are the feature gaps in the tooling and infrastructure used to operationalize ML models?}
\end{itemize}
The results show multiple methods of operationalization with varying complexity and architectures.
