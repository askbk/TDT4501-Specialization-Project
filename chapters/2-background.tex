\chapter{Background}
This section will briefly explain status of machine learning today, technical debt in ML systems, the value of iterating fast, value of reproducibility/repeatability, other quality attributes.
Motivate the need for MLOps.

\section{Machine Learning}
Adoption of machine learning is growing, and is providing value in a wide array of different fields.
Most companies are still in the very early stages of incorporating ML in their business processes.

\section{Software Engineering for ML systems}
ML systems accrue a lot of technical debt according to \textcite{Sculley2015}.
The Software Engineering for Machine Learning movement aims to bring already well-established best practices from the SE domain to the field of ML.

\section{DevOps for ML systems -- \emph{MLOps}}
DevOps for Machine Learning, or MLOps for short, is a subset of SE4ML, focused on adopting DevOps practices when developing and operating ML systems.
