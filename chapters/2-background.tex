\chapter{Background}
This section will briefly explain status of machine learning today, technical debt in ML systems, the value of iterating fast, value of reproducibility/repeatability, other quality attributes.
Motivate the need for MLOps.

\section{Machine Learning}
Adoption of \acrshort{ml} is growing, and is providing value in a wide array of different fields.
Most companies are still in the very early stages of incorporating \acrshort{ml} in their business processes.
\textcite{mckinsey2020} reports 50\% of businesses surveyed have adopted \acrshort{ai} in some business function.

\section{Software Engineering for ML systems}
ML systems accrue a lot of \gls{technical_debt} according to \textcite{Sculley2015}.
In addition to the technical
The Software Engineering for Machine Learning movement aims to bring already well-established best practices from the SE domain to the field of ML.

\section{DevOps for ML systems -- \emph{MLOps}}
DevOps for Machine Learning, or MLOps for short, is a subset of SE4ML, focused on adopting DevOps practices when developing and operating ML systems.
