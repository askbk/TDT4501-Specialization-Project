\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}
This chapter will briefly explain status of machine learning today, technical debt in ML systems and motivate the need for MLOps.

\section{Machine Learning}
Adoption of \acrshort{ml} is growing, and is providing value in a wide array of different fields.
\textcite{mckinsey2020} reports that 50\% of businesses surveyed have adopted \acrshort{ai} in some business function.
However, most companies are still in the very early stages of incorporating \acrshort{ml} in their business processes \cite{Schloegl2019}.
\todo[inline]{Add a bit more on adoption of ML. Maybe technology developments.}

\section{Software Engineering for ML Systems}
\todo{Add softer introduction..}
ML systems accrue a lot of \gls{technical_debt} according to \textcite{Sculley2015}.
This is because in addition to the technical debt incurred by being a software system, with the usual tech debt associated with code, ML systems also have entangled data dependencies.
The Software Engineering for Machine Learning movement aims to bring already well-established best practices from the SE domain to the field of ML [cite].
\todo{Add some more content.}

\section{DevOps for ML Systems -- \emph{MLOps}}
DevOps is a subset of software engineering focused on tightening the coupling between development and operation of software systems.
DevOps principles advocate for process automation [cite], which is often expressed through the use of version control systems, automated build and deploy pipelines, etc [cite].
Some motivating factors for automation are shortening the time to delivery, increasing reproducibility and reducing time spent on automatable processes [cite].
DevOps for Machine Learning, named MLOps, is a subset of SE4ML and a superset/extension of DevOps, focused on adopting DevOps practices when developing and operating ML systems [cite].
This is because existing DevOps practices are not sufficient for ML systems, which pose additional requirements [cite].
ML systems not only have code dependencies, but have data dependencies in addition, which may impose the requirement of data monitoring (for data distributions shift), continuous training or automatic retraining, etc.

\section{Deploying ML Systems}
\label{sec:deploying_ml_systems}
The deployment step consists of taking the system from a development environment (e.g. local development machine) to a production environment (e.g. a server).
Deployment in the context of this paper will encompass all steps that come after model training and evaluation, which typically includes (but is not restricted to): packaging model in a format appropriate for deployment, publishing to a model registry, integration into a broader software system, serving, and monitoring.
Further, infrastructure and configuration will also be included in the term \emph{deployment}.
