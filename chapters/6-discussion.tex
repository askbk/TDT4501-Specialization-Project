\section{Threats to Validity}
Being an \acrshort{mlr}, there are certain inherent threats to validity.
There is the possibility that not all relevant literature was found or included.
To mitigate this, the start set included papers spanning multiple years (2017-2021), venues (IEEE, ACM, Sciendo, Frontiers, Sciencedirect, Zenodo, IGI Global, Wiley, MDPI, Springer) and authors.
However, as the snowballing procedure was only limited to a single iteration of forward and backward snowballing, instead of continuing until no new studies are found, it is quite probable that this review is not exhaustive.

As the review was conducted by a single person, there is the probability of bias and mistakes.
To control for bias, a sensitivity analysis was performed by synthesizing extracted data from a random subset of the review body in order to determine if the conclusion would differ significantly.

Being a qualitative study, most aspects of the research are subjective to at least a certain degree, for example in determining the relevance of a study, assessing the quality of a study, or interpretation of extracted data.
