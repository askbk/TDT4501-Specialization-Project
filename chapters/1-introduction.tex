\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}
Background:
Machine learning models have become increasingly prevalent in virtually all fields of business and research in the past decade, with a steady stream of new algorithms and techniques being published.
However, deploying models to production with the same level of rigor and automation as traditional software systems has shown itself to be a non-trivial task.
As a result, MLOps --- an extension of DevOps to include ML systems --- and SE for ML in general, is experiencing increased attention from researchers and practitioners.

Motivation:
In recent years, several literature reviews have been conducted to investigate the intersection of SE and ML.
\cite{Baier2019, Kumeno2020} are some early examples.
In this review, the deployment of ML models and the surrounding infrastructure is the subject of investigation.
This entails everything that happens after a model has been trained and evaluated, from packaging and integration, to serving and monitoring.
The different approaches described in literature will be described, together with tools used and challenges often encountered.
In addition, reported gaps in current tooling will also be investigated in order to provide opportunities for future contributions.

RQs

Method:
The review was conducted based on the guidelines of \cite{Kitchenham07guidelinesfor} and \cite{Wohlin2014}.
