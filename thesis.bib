This paper argues it is dangerous to think ofthese quick wins as coming for free. Using the software engineering frameworkof technical debt, we find it is common to incur massive ongoing maintenancecosts in real-world ML systems. We explore several ML-specific risk factors toaccount for in system design. These include boundary erosion, entanglement,hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, configurationissues, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns.},

However, the deployment of machine learning models in production systems can present a number of issues and concerns. This survey reviews published reports of deploying machine learning solutions in a variety of use cases, industries and applications and extracts practical considerations corresponding to stages of the machine learning deployment workflow. Our survey shows that practitioners face challenges at each stage of the deployment. The goal of this paper is to layout a research agenda to explore approaches addressing these challenges.},

  abstract      = {SAP is the market leader in enterprise software offering an end-to-end suite of applications and services to enable their customers worldwide to operate their business. Especially, retail customers of SAP deal with millions of sales transactions for their day-to-day business. Transactions are created during retail sales at the point of sale (POS) terminals and then sent to some central servers for validations and other business operations. A considerable proportion of the retail transactions may have inconsistencies due to many technical and human errors. SAP provides an automated process for error detection but still requires a manual process by dedicated employees using workbench software for correction. However, manual corrections of these errors are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may lead to further errors due to incorrect modifications. This is not only a performance overhead on the customers' business workflow but it also incurs high operational costs. Thus, automated detection and correction of transaction errors are very important regarding their potential business values and the improvement in the business workflow. In this paper, we present an industrial case study where we apply machine learning (ML) to automatically detect transaction errors and propose corrections. We identify and discuss the challenges that we faced during this collaborative research and development project, from three distinct perspectives: Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and industry-academia collaboration. We report on our experience and insights from the project with guidelines for the identified challenges. We believe that our findings and recommendations can help researchers and practitioners embarking into similar endeavors.},

These lessons are presented in the form of antipatterns. Just as design patterns codify best software engineering practices, antipatterns provide a vocabulary to describe defective practices and methodologies. Here we catalog and document numerous antipatterns in financial ML operations (MLOps). Some antipatterns are due to technical errors, while others are due to not having sufficient knowledge of the surrounding context in which ML results are used. By providing a common vocabulary to discuss these situations, our intent is that antipatterns will support better documentation of issues, rapid communication between stakeholders, and faster resolution of problems. In addition to cataloging antipatterns, we describe solutions, best practices, and future directions toward MLOps maturity.},

However, the translation of a prediction algorithm into an operationally usable machine learning model is a time-consuming and in various ways challenging task. In this work, we target to systematically elicit the challenges in deployment and operation to enable broader practical dissemination of machine learning applications. To this end, we first identify relevant challenges with a structured literature analysis. Subsequently, we conduct an interview study with machine learning practitioners across various industries, perform a qualitative content analysis, and identify challenges organized along three distinct categories as well as six overarching clusters. Eventually, results from both literature and interviews are evaluated with a comparative analysis. Key issues identified include automated strategies for data drift detection and handling, standardization of machine learning infrastructure, and appropriate communication and expectation management.},

  abstract      = {Following continuous software engineering practices, there has been an increasing interest in rapid deployment of machine learning (ML) features, called MLOps. In this paper, we study the importance of MLOps in the context of data scientists' daily activities, based on a survey where we collected responses from 331 professionals from 63 different countries in ML domain, indicating on what they were working on in the last three months. Based on the results, up to 40% respondents say that they work with both models and infrastructure; the majority of the work revolves around relational and time series data; and the largest categories of problems to be solved are predictive analysis, time series data, and computer vision. The biggest perceived problems revolve around data, although there is some awareness of problems related to deploying models to production and related procedures. To hypothesise, we believe that organisations represented in the survey can be divided to three categories -- (i) figuring out how to best use data; (ii) focusing on building the first models and getting them to production; and (iii) managing several models, their versions and training datasets, as well as retraining and frequent deployment of retrained models. In the results, the majority of respondents are in category (i) or (ii), focusing on data and models; however the benefits of MLOps only emerge in category (iii) when there is a need for frequent retraining and redeployment. Hence, setting up an MLOps pipeline is a natural step to take, when an organization takes the step from ML as a proof-of-concept to ML as a part of nominal activities.},

However, developing AI/ML systems has presented several engineering problems that are different from those that arise in, non-AI/ML software development. This study aims to investigate how software engineering (SE) has been applied in the development of AI/ML systems and identify challenges and practices that are applicable and determine whether they meet the needs of professionals. Also, we assessed whether these SE practices apply to different contexts, and in which areas they may be applicable. We conducted a systematic review of literature from 1990 to 2019 to (i) understand and summarize the current state of the art in this field and (ii) analyze its limitations and open challenges that will drive future research. Our results show these systems are developed on a lab context or a large company and followed a research-driven development process. The main challenges faced by professionals are in areas of testing, AI software quality, and data management. The contribution types of most of the proposed SE practices are guidelines, lessons learned, and tools.},
