This paper argues it is dangerous to think ofthese quick wins as coming for free. Using the software engineering frameworkof technical debt, we find it is common to incur massive ongoing maintenancecosts in real-world ML systems. We explore several ML-specific risk factors toaccount for in system design. These include boundary erosion, entanglement,hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, configurationissues, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns.},

However, the deployment of machine learning models in production systems can present a number of issues and concerns. This survey reviews published reports of deploying machine learning solutions in a variety of use cases, industries and applications and extracts practical considerations corresponding to stages of the machine learning deployment workflow. Our survey shows that practitioners face challenges at each stage of the deployment. The goal of this paper is to layout a research agenda to explore approaches addressing these challenges.},

Here we catalog and document numerous antipatterns in financial ML operations (MLOps). Some antipatterns are due to technical errors, while others are due to not having sufficient knowledge of the surrounding context in which ML results are used. By providing a common vocabulary to discuss these situations, our intent is that antipatterns will support better documentation of issues, rapid communication between stakeholders, and faster resolution of problems. In addition to cataloging antipatterns, we describe solutions, best practices, and future directions toward MLOps maturity.},

However, the translation of a prediction algorithm into an operationally usable machine learning model is a time-consuming and in various ways challenging task. In this work, we target to systematically elicit the challenges in deployment and operation to enable broader practical dissemination of machine learning applications. To this end, we first identify relevant challenges with a structured literature analysis. Subsequently, we conduct an interview study with machine learning practitioners across various industries, perform a qualitative content analysis, and identify challenges organized along three distinct categories as well as six overarching clusters. Eventually, results from both literature and interviews are evaluated with a comparative analysis. Key issues identified include automated strategies for data drift detection and handling, standardization of machine learning infrastructure, and appropriate communication and expectation management.},

  abstract      = {Following continuous software engineering practices, there has been an increasing interest in rapid deployment of machine learning (ML) features, called MLOps. In this paper, we study the importance of MLOps in the context of data scientists' daily activities, based on a survey where we collected responses from 331 professionals from 63 different countries in ML domain, indicating on what they were working on in the last three months. Based on the results, up to 40% respondents say that they work with both models and infrastructure; the majority of the work revolves around relational and time series data; and the largest categories of problems to be solved are predictive analysis, time series data, and computer vision. The biggest perceived problems revolve around data, although there is some awareness of problems related to deploying models to production and related procedures. To hypothesise, we believe that organisations represented in the survey can be divided to three categories -- (i) figuring out how to best use data; (ii) focusing on building the first models and getting them to production; and (iii) managing several models, their versions and training datasets, as well as retraining and frequent deployment of retrained models. In the results, the majority of respondents are in category (i) or (ii), focusing on data and models; however the benefits of MLOps only emerge in category (iii) when there is a need for frequent retraining and redeployment. Hence, setting up an MLOps pipeline is a natural step to take, when an organization takes the step from ML as a proof-of-concept to ML as a part of nominal activities.},

  abstract      = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) systems have been widely adopted as value propositions by companies in all industries in order to create or extend the services and products they offer. However, developing AI/ML systems has presented several engineering problems that are different from those that arise in, non-AI/ML software development. This study aims to investigate how software engineering (SE) has been applied in the development of AI/ML systems and identify challenges and practices that are applicable and determine whether they meet the needs of professionals. Also, we assessed whether these SE practices apply to different contexts, and in which areas they may be applicable. We conducted a systematic review of literature from 1990 to 2019 to (i) understand and summarize the current state of the art in this field and (ii) analyze its limitations and open challenges that will drive future research. Our results show these systems are developed on a lab context or a large company and followed a research-driven development process. The main challenges faced by professionals are in areas of testing, AI software quality, and data management. The contribution types of most of the proposed SE practices are guidelines, lessons learned, and tools.},
  archiveprefix = {arXiv},
  comment       = {SLR of SE practices for ML.
Mapped practices to chapters of SWEBOK, similarly to Kumeno,  although with a more comprehensive analysis.  The authors found that studies from laboratory environments are mainly concerned with building and testing models, which could indicate that more literature produced by industry practitioners should be studied when looking to review the state of the art and state of practice of deploying models to production.  This is further illustrated when the authors highlight that deployment is one of the areas with the fewest suggested practices in published literature.

RQ: How is software engineering applied in the development of AI/ML systems?

RQ1. What types of AI/ML systems are investigated in the primary studies?  
RQ2. What is the organizational context of the AI/ML system development?  
RQ3. Which challenges are related to specific aspects of AI/ML development?  
RQ4. How  are  SE  practices  adjusted  to  deal  with  specific AI/ML  engineering challenges?  
RQ5. What SE practices are reported in the primary studies?   
RQ6. Which type of empirical methods are used?

Contributions: The  study  provides  a  comprehensive  view  of  the  software  industry  regarding  the development of AI/ML systems and lists the main challenges faced. 
II. The  study  synthesizes  the  contextual  setting  of  investigated  SE  practices,  and infers the area of applicability of the empirical findings., It also presents the classification of  SE  practice  types  in  the  form  of  lessons  learned,  structure,  guidelines,  theory,  tools, model, or advice. This can help to compare and generalize future research on SE practices for AI/ML systems.

Fails to mention the work of Kumeno, despite being submitted to arXiv 9 months later.

First uses DB search, then snowballing. 30+25 papers reviewed total.

Provides tables for "SE approaches, processes, practices, or tools reported", but only for areas for testing, configuration management, and design.

Looks at reported challenges vs proposed solutions. Many proposed solutions are not tested in industrial settings. Most proposed solutions are related to testing. 

Investigates settings in which the primary studies were conducted (research institution, small company, large company, etc)

More rigorous than Kumeno. Study performed by 3 researchers, coding process reviewed by two researchers.},

  abstract      = {With the development and the increasing interests in ML/DL fields, companies are eager to apply Machine Learning/Deep Learning approaches to increase service quality and customer experience. Federated Learning was implemented as an effective model training method for distributing and accelerating time-consuming model training while protecting user data privacy. However, common Federated Learning approaches, on the other hand, use a synchronous protocol to conduct model aggregation, which is inflexible and unable to adapt to rapidly changing environments and heterogeneous hardware settings in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present an approach to real-time end-to-end Federated Learning combined with a novel asynchronous model aggregation protocol. Our method is validated in an industrial use case in the automotive domain, focusing on steering wheel angle prediction for autonomous driving. Our findings show that asynchronous Federated Learning can significantly improve the prediction performance of local edge models while maintaining the same level of accuracy as centralized machine learning. Furthermore, by using a sliding training window, the approach can minimize communication overhead, accelerate model training speed and consume real-time streaming data, proving high efficiency when deploying ML/DL components to heterogeneous real-world embedded systems.},

The problems regarding Machine Learning Development involves the fact that such professionals do not realize that they usually perform ad-hoc practices that could be improved by the adoption of activities presented in the Software Engineering Development Lifecycle. Of course, since machine learning systems are different from traditional Software systems, some differences in their respective development processes are to be expected. In this context, this paper is an effort to investigate the challenges and practices that emerge during the development of ML models from the software engineering perspective by focusing on understanding how software developers could benefit from applying or adapting the traditional software engineering process to the Machine Learning workflow.},

  abstract      = {AI-based systems are software systems with functionalities enabled by at least one AI component (e.g., for image- and speech-recognition, and autonomous driving). AI-based systems are becoming pervasive in society due to advances in AI. However, there is limited synthesized knowledge on Software Engineering (SE) approaches for building, operating, and maintaining AI-based systems. To collect and analyze state-of-the-art knowledge about SE for AI-based systems, we conducted a systematic mapping study. We considered 248 studies published between January 2010 and March 2020. SE for AI-based systems is an emerging research area, where more than 2/3 of the studies have been published since 2018. The most studied properties of AI-based systems are dependability and safety. We identified multiple SE approaches for AI-based systems, which we classified according to the SWEBOK areas. Studies related to software testing and software quality are very prevalent, while areas like software maintenance seem neglected. Data-related issues are the most recurrent challenges. Our results are valuable for: researchers, to quickly understand the state of the art and learn which topics need more research; practitioners, to learn about the approaches and challenges that SE entails for AI-based systems; and, educators, to bridge the gap among SE and AI in their curricula.},

  abstract      = {Specific developmental and operational characteristics of machine learning (ML) components, as well as their inherent uncertainty, demand robust engineering principles are used to ensure their quality. We aim to determine how software systems can be (re-) architected to enable robust integration of ML components. Towards this goal, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study consisting of (i) a systematic literature review to identify the challenges and their solutions in software architecture forML, (ii) semi-structured interviews with practitioners to qualitatively complement the initial findings, and (iii) a survey to quantitatively validate the challenges and their solutions. In total, we compiled and validated twenty challenges and solutions for (re-) architecting systems with ML components. Our results indicate, for example, that traditional software architecture challenges (e.g., component coupling) also play an important role when using ML components; along new ML specific challenges (e.g., the need for continuous retraining). Moreover, the results indicate that ML heightened decision drivers, such as privacy, play a marginal role compared to traditional decision drivers, such as scalability or interoperability. Using the survey, we were able to establish a link between architectural solutions and software quality attributes; which enabled us to provide twenty architectural tactics used for satisfying individual quality requirements of systems with ML components. Altogether, the results can be interpreted as an empirical framework that supports the process of (re-) architecting software systems with ML components.},

  abstract      = {Machine learning (ML) and AI toolboxes such as scikit-learn or Weka are workhorses of contemporary data scientific practice -- their central role being enabled by usable yet powerful designs that allow to easily specify, train and validate complex modeling pipelines. However, despite their universal success, the key design principles in their construction have never been fully analyzed. In this paper, we attempt to provide an overview of key patterns in the design of AI modeling toolboxes, taking inspiration, in equal parts, from the field of software engineering, implementation patterns found in contemporary toolboxes, and our own experience from developing ML toolboxes. In particular, we develop a conceptual model for the AI/ML domain, with a new type system, called scientific types, at its core. Scientific types capture the scientific meaning of common elements in ML workflows based on the set of operations that we usually perform with them (i.e. their interface) and their statistical properties. From our conceptual analysis, we derive a set of design principles and patterns. We illustrate that our analysis can not only explain the design of existing toolboxes, but also guide the development of new ones. We intend our contribution to be a state-of-art reference for future toolbox engineers, a summary of best practices, a collection of ML design patterns which may become useful for future research, and, potentially, the first steps towards a higher-level programming paradigm for constructing AI.},
